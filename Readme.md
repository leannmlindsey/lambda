Transformer-based sequence models trained on genomic datasets have become powerful tools for analyzing genomic sequences. Current genomic benchmarks mainly focus on eukaryotic regulatory elements, leading to the development of foundation models pre-trained primarily on human genomes. Advancing the computational tools available to study bacteria can significantly impact human health, since bacteria can act as both pathogens and symbiotic partners of their human hosts. Some bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, have the ability to integrate into the host bacterial genome as prophages, which can significantly impact bacterial fitness and pathogenicity. Prophage genomes are diverse, lacking universal markers or features, and frequently undergo recombination with other bacteriophages and bacteria. These properties make prophage sequences challenging to detect, as there is no clear delineation between the segments of viral and bacterial DNA. We introduce LAMBDA, a prophage detection benchmark for genomic language models that evaluates models through binary classification of genomic segments, and detection of prophage locations against annotated reference datasets. This benchmark presents a challenging long-range task for genomic language models in the bacterial domain, addressing a key computational problem for the microbiology and medical community.
